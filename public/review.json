    "review": "I've had my bike for a while now and it's been through a lot. I can't say enough good things about it. It's survived being hit by a car, jumping off of ramp in that lake and being tossed out of the back of a truck...and all without even one scratch or dent! It's an investment that has paid off many times over."
